## run_Analysis.R 

  the final script that downloads, cleans, and summarizes the data set. It meets the requirments set within the coursera project:

  1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

  the final output is the tables total_data(steps 1-4) and total_data2(step 5).

## CodeBook.md

  contains a description of all of the variables used and manipulations performed in creating total_data and total_data2.
  
## total_data.txt

  a txt file of the table output from steps 1-4 of the analysis.
  
## total_data2.txt
  a txt file of the table output from step 5 of the analysis
 
## getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI HAR Dataset
  two versions with the zipped and unzipped data sets downloaded from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
